It removes the machinery and puts you one step closer to the elements. And it's a complete physical expression of freedom. <span id="author"><strong>R.Redford</strong></span>

						<strong>
							<p>
								Jahorina is a beautiful mountain. The view from the top is really breathtaking. If there is no snow and it is not too cold be sure to choose a walk to the top. Aside from the fun, the fresh mountain air will make you sick. At the end of the day, make sure you stop by one of the many cafes and warm up with brewed wine or traditional tea.
								Jahorina is known for its nightlife and partying. Music is heard from all sides, so wherever you go you will have fun.
								Newer hotels and accommodations offer wellness and spa programs. Almost all major hotels have swimming pools. Billiards, bowling, table tennis, darts are very popular because the day on the mountain ends earlier than in the city.

						<h2 data-aos="fade-right"><span>A</span>spen</h2>
						<strong>
							<p>
								With 91 downhill trails covering more than 150 miles, and a total of 3,332 skiable acres — a third more skiable terrain than the other three Aspen areas combined — there’s a reason locals call this place Snowmassive. And here, size is a good thing. Not only can you ski or board all day without covering the same area twice, but there’s an average of just two people per acre, which means plenty of space for making those tricks and turns, and moments where you’ll feel like you’re riding your own private mountain.
								If you got a bit too lively during après the night before, that doesn’t mean you’ll be waking up to skied-out trails. Every day at Snowmass, the rope closing off one freshly groomed trail — usually a blue or black run — isn’t lifted till midday. It’s called the Noon Groom, and it means you always get the chance to make first tracks. And of course, that low number of skiers per acre and the sheer size of Snowmass both help powder days feel longer here, so you’ll never have to feel guilty about starting out late on the slopes.
